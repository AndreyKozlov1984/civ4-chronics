There are units on the map, and each turn a unit may do some action

*Battles*
Unit have some battle parameters. But just for start it is strength, i.e. base number from 1 till about 10.
Strength is determined on unit type. Thus there are several unit types, like Warrior, Archer, Axeman, Cavarly.
Initial list of units:
    Warrior: Strength: 1,   Move: 1,   
    Archer:  Strength: 3,   Move: 2

**Modifiers
A set of modifiers is applied to both attacking(A) and defending(D) units. Modifier is a float, like 1.3 which is mutplipled by a strength.
So the archer defender in a forest may have a 1.5 multiplier.

After applying modifiers the result strenths are used to decide who wins the battle: A: 5 and D: 10 means that attacker has 5/15 chances to win and the defender has 10/15 chances to win

Modifier types:
    based on a terran type: 1.5 for a forest, 1.2 for hills, 0.8 for plains
    based on attacker/defender special combinations:  
        spearman vs horseman,  horseman vs archer, axeman vs warrior: 2x modifier
        missile attack on a melee unit from hills to plains: 2x modifier

    tactic based modifier for both attacker and defender

**Pre game tactics
    a player may choose a tactic for each unit in a battle. Tactic depends on unit type, terrain conditions, availability of other units.
    Tactic:
    Attacker - basic attack, default tactic for melee units
    Missile unit with a long range attack versus melee units: enemy may flee in fear
    Ambush
    Defender - Eager counter attack: Flip sides and attempt a counter attack on a marching army: can be made only once per turn and available only if unit has not made a move last turn. Attacker receives 0.5 modifier for being in charge and looses all modifier bonuses. Defender has all modifiers
    Attacker - Cautious attack. 0.8 attack modifier, but in case of counter attack
